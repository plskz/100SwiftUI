My solutions to Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) projects and challenges.

## üîñ Projects

These projects helped and guided me through Swift and SwiftUI, but also offered me the opportunity of solving a couple of challenges by myself each time.

- [Project 1 - WeSplit](/01-WeSplit/)
- [Project 2 - Guess the Flag](/03-Guess%20the%20Flag/)
- [Project 3 - Views and Modifiers](/04-Views%20and%20Modifiers/)
- Project 4 - BetterRest
- Project 5 - WordScramble
- ...

## üèÜ Challenges

Challenges were projects I developed by myself starting from the basic requirements outlined in the course.

- [Checkpoints](/00-Checkpoint/)
- [Challenge Day - Unit Converter](/02-Challenge%20Day/)
- Milestone 1 - Rock Paper Scissor - üöß In Progress
- ...
